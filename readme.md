## Known limitation
This package is only the sample code to show the concept. It does not have a full validation such as robustness functional test and fuzzing test. It does not meet the production quality yet. Any codes including the API definition, the libary and the drivers are subject to change.


## Support no std use

for UEFI, export functions, traits and structs from std
